### Installing MiNET
There are a few ways you can download MiNET. 

**Compile from source**  
You can compile directly from source code in the [Github repository](https://github.com/NiclasOlofsson/MiNET). 
  
##### Windows  
On Windows you can simply compile using Visual Studio. Google it, untill i provide a full tutorial.
  
##### Linux  
Unfortunatly you cannot install MiNET on Linux, due to he fact that mono does not support encryption.
  
**Installing from AppVeyor**  
AppVeyor is used to build MiNET to make sure there are no errors. It also hosts artifacts, which can he downloaded [here](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/NiclasOlofsson/MiNET/branch/master/artifacts).
